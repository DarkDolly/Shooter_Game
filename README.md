TEST

On commit "Added fire rate system on Gun.cpp at the PullTrigger function" when I tried adding the system on ShooterCharacter.cpp at the Fire function, it broke the death animation for some reason.

On commit "lecture 216" made the MaxHealth in ShooterCharacter.h EditAnywhere so I could change the max health for specific actors without affecting unwanted actors (For an example make the AIs have 40 health compared to my 100 health so they die faster)
